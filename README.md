# Election Analysis
This project is based on writing a code on python to analys election result in different county.

## Overview of Project
The project is on an election that took place in three different county, a csv format of the election result will be use as a guide to write the coded needed to obtain a detaild  election results in a text format. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help the lectorial commission to have an easy electorial count on votes and to get a well proccessed detailed result that will show the how the results are been collated based on county, candidate, and votes. The code will not only get the results and fine tune it to actually determine the winners by count but also by poercentage.

## Election Audit Result 
The election was conducted in three different counties between three candidates. The counties are Arapahoe, Denver, and Jefferson. The candidates are Diana DeGette, Charles Casper Stockham, and Raymon Anthony Doane. The total county votes was 369,711 and the percentage of votes splitted between each counties are Arapahoe 6.7%, Denver 82.8%, and Jefferson 10.5%, which means Denver has the largest number of votes. To arrive at the percentage of votes, I used a simply mathematical expression which is {Vote% = county vote/ total vote * 100} from this mathetical expression i was able to get the percentage of each vote in each county. From the mathematical expression the percentage of votes won by Charles Casper Stockham 23.0% (85,213 votes), Diana DeGette 73.8% (272,892 votes), Raymon Anthony Doane 3.1% (11,606 votes). The winner of the election is Diana DeGette with 73.8% (272,892 votes) of 369,711.

## Summary
The electorial analysis project is a project that the commision can capitalize on and make a success in every electorial election in the country. The program can be modified to occupy more than three counties up to 50 states with the same effective and detailed result. For example we can change the county to state which will goive us the result of an entire state and also we can modify the candidates to as many candidates as possible. This will not only make the elctorial countung process a swift one but it can also be used in electorial future years to come.
